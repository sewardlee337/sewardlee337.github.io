  I am a data scientist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. By day, I work in
  the Utilities SaaS division at <a href="https://www.oracle.com/index.html">
  Oracle</a>. By night, I volunteer with <a href = "http://www.datakind.org/">
  DataKind</a> to provide pro bono data science services to mission-driven
  nonprofits. I also contribute to NASA open innovation projects as a member
  of the <a href = "https://open.nasa.gov/explore/datanauts/">NASA Datanauts</a>
  initiative.
</p>

<p>
I am an excitable nerd with a strong interest in open source software, science
fiction, and strong coffee.
