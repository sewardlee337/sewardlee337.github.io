                        <p class="lead">Yes, my coverage on the fiscal cliff is a bit belated – especially considering how daily news headlines have been screaming “<i>FISCAL CLIFF!!!</i>” for the past several weeks now. Given the scope of the problem and the amount of media attention it’s been receiving, this is likely the first of several posts that I will write on the topic. So periodically check in to see if I have more to say on the matter.</p>

                        <div id="post-content">
                            <p>As you must have undoubtedly noticed, Washington's handling of the fiscal cliff has turned into a protracted game of political chicken.  My job will be to help you cut through the politicking and clearly see the economic ramifications of the problem. For the record, I sincerely hope that lawmakers will strike a reasonable deal before we slip off the cliff on January 1st. If not, at least my coverage will replace your general sense of unease with a specific and gripping fear of what’s to come. (Hey, economics is not called “the dismal science” for nothing.)</p>

                            <h4>The Basics</h4>

                            <p> The term "fiscal cliff" refers to a round of fiscal tightening that's scheduled to occur at the beginning of next year. Federal taxes will increase, and federal spending will be cut. Given the weak state of our current economy, having all the scheduled tightening come to pass will push us back into a recession. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that this will cause unemployment to rise to 9.1% by the fourth quarter of 2013. However, if fiscal tightening were avoided altogether, our tendency to incur deficits might cause our federal debt to soar to unsustainable rates.</p>
                            
                            <br>
                            
                            <p>This, therefore, begs the question of which tax increases and spending cuts should and should not be enacted. A glance at the headlines will show that Democrats and Republicans are not making progress deciding upon this matter. Needless to say, if they can't strike a deal by the time the clock stops ticking, our descent into a new recession begins.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h4>Overview of Spending Cuts</h4>

                            <p>Federal spending cuts associated with the fiscal cliff include:</p>
                            
                            <ul>
                                <li>Automatic spending cuts ("sequestration") as mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011</li>
                                <li>Reduction in Medicare payments to doctors</li>
                                <li>Expiration of unemployment benefits</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The Budget Control Act was the spawn of the debt ceiling debacle that took place in Washington last summer. As Ezra Klein explained, it contains "automatic spending cuts to domestic programs to hurt Democrats and automatic spending cuts to defense to hurt Republicans." The threat of these cuts was supposed to force the two parties to work together to fix our deficit problems. These cuts are blunt and indiscriminate, and were meant to scare members of Congress into cooperation.  But thanks to their pathological inability to compromise, the possibility of these cuts taking place is becoming bigger and bigger.</p> 

                            <p>The Office of Management and Budget estimates that sequestration, as mandated by the Budget Control Act, would lead to a 9.4% cut in non-exempt discretionary defense spending and an 8.2% cut in non-exempt non-defense spending. It would also lead to a 2% cut in Medicare spending, a 7.6% cut in other non-exempt non-defense spending, and a 10% cut in non-exempt mandatory defense spending. If these cuts were to take place, there might be wide-ranging consequences in areas ranging from national defense to welfare, from public health to education, etc. This is not to mention the effects that these cuts would have in lowering output and increasing unemployment in the U.S. economy.</p>

                            <p>We can avoid these indiscriminate cuts if we reach an alternate deal that lowers the deficit by $1.2 trillion by 2021. Given the way our deal-making process works, though, what we currently have is a mess on our hands.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h4>Overview of Tax Increases</h4>

                            <p>On the other end, we have tax increases. Tax changes scheduled to come into effect in 2013 include:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Expiration of Bush-era tax cuts</li>
                                <li>Expiration of three tax cut provisions from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009</li>
                                <li>Fall in exemption for estate tax</li>
                                <li>Fall in exemption for Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</li>
                                <li>Expiration of 2010 payroll tax cut</li>
                                <li>Tax increases related to Obamacare</li>
                                <li>Expiration of short-term tax provisions that Congress regularly extends</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>Each tax increase has different effects on different segments of the American population. Therefore, the delineation of what needs to change and what needs to stay the same is a sore point of contention for Democrats and Republicans.</p>

                            <p>The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that slipping off the cliff altogether will lead to a tax increase for 90% of Americans. On average, taxes will increase by roughly $3,500 per household; middle-income households would see an average increase of about $2,000. This would obviously depress consumer spending, thereby reducing output and increasing unemployment in the macroeconomy.</p>

                            <br>

                            <h4><i>Quo Vadis?</i></h4>

                            <p>For now, there's one final point that I want you to consider. I can explain the fiscal cliff and tell you what policies I favor, but I can’t decide your beliefs and values for you. Behind the positive economics of the fiscal cliff is a set of values-based choices that we, as a society, need to make. For example: In the near future, do we want to live in a country with low unemployment or low debt? Who do we think should bear the brunt of the tax burden? Which government services can we live without?</p>

                            <p>The choices are yours. Or more accurately, the choices belong to the policymakers you sent to Washington. So I hope that the legislator you voted for was elected to office. If not, then it’s all the more important that you make your voice heard. Remember, you always have the option to unleash a flood of emails upon your Member of Congress's poor interns.</p>
