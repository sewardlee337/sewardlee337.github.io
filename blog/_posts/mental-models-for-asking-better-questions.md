Asking good questions is an underappreciated art, but it's a vitally important one. Elon Musk famously identified asking good questions as a creative skill, and pointed out that ["if you can properly phrase the question, the answer is the easy part."](https://www.inc.com/lisa-calhoun/elon-musk-on-the-1-creative-skill-every-founder-needs-now.html) If you want to think clearly, act decisively, and become a great leader, do not underestimate the power of good questions.

It would be silly to assume that there's a grand theory or ultimate recipe that can teach you how to ask great questions. I think the best approach is to engage the topic using the ["latticework of mental models" approach](https://fs.blog/mental-models/#what_are_mental_models) popularized by Charlie Munger and Shane Parrish. That is, assemble a diverse toolbox of concepts and frameworks that will allow you to solve a wide range of problems.

If you want to improve your ability to ask good questions, I'd recommend the following mental models for your toolbox.

## The Curse of Knowledge

The "Curse of Knowledge" is a concept that I came across in Steven Pinker's book [_The Sense of Style_](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+sense+of+style&qid=1601685261&sr=8-1).

When you ask a question - particularly in a workplace setting - do not presume that people can read your mind.  


## Six Thinking Hats

Edward De Bono developed the "Six Thinking Hats" system of parallel thinking so that participants in meetings are encouraged to think about problems from many different angles.

## Black Swans

Here, I'm not talking about the [famous movie starring Natalie Portman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)), nor am I quite referring to Nassim Nicholas Taleb's ["black swan theory"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) (although there's a family resemblance to the latter). According to former FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss, a "black swan" is a piece of information you are currently not privy to that can completely reshape your understanding of a given situation.

In his book [_Never Split the Difference_](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1601685234&sr=8-1), Voss explains that...
